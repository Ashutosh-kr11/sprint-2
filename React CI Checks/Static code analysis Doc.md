## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to implementing static code analysis in React applications within CI/CD pipelines. It covers various tools, best practices, and recommendations for maintaining high code quality standards in modern JavaScript/TypeScript development environments.

Static code analysis is essential for React development as it helps maintain code quality, enforces consistent patterns, identifies security vulnerabilities, and catches potential bugs in JavaScript/TypeScript code before they reach production.

---

## What is Static Code Analysis?

Static code analysis is the process of examining React/JavaScript/TypeScript source code without executing it to identify:
- **Code quality issues** (complexity, maintainability, readability)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript errors** (syntax errors, type mismatches)
- **Security vulnerabilities** (XSS, unsafe patterns, dependency vulnerabilities)
- **React-specific issues** (hooks usage, component patterns, performance)
- **Accessibility violations** (a11y compliance)
- **Unused code** (dead imports, unused variables)
- **Bundle size issues** (large dependencies, inefficient imports)
- **Performance anti-patterns** (unnecessary re-renders, memory leaks)

### Key Characteristics:
- Automated examination of React/JS/TS source code
- No code execution required
- Early detection of issues in development cycle
- Integration with modern build tools (Webpack, Vite, etc.)
- Support for JSX, ES6+, and TypeScript
- React-specific rule sets and patterns
